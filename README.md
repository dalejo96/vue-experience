# Vue-experience

This is my journey and experience with the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework.

Every folder contains an application, from the simple CounterApp to ...

## Folders - Projects

- *CounterApp*: a basic JS counter with two buttons one for subtraction and the other to add 1 to the general count, includes an Options API vs Composition API approach to solve the problem.

- *NotesApp*: a JS notes application with a modal, a textarea and some buttons, here you can see some vue directives, iteratively rendering DOM elements and some error handling.

## Development

If you want to check any project just go to the respective folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
